## Vulnerability Summary

### Severity Breakdown

| Severity | Count |
|--------|------:|
| Critical | 1 |
| High | 3 |
| Medium | 2 |
| Low | 1 |
| Informational | 40 |
| **Total** | **47** |

---

## Critical Vulnerabilities

| Plugin ID | CVSS | Vulnerability Name |
|----------|------|-------------------|
| 51988 | 9.8 | Bind Shell Backdoor Detection |

**Description:**  
A bind shell backdoor was detected, allowing remote command execution.  
This represents a **severe security risk** and could lead to full system compromise.

---

## High Severity Vulnerabilities

| Plugin ID | CVSS | Vulnerability Name |
|----------|------|-------------------|
| 136769 | 8.6 | ISC BIND Service Downgrade / Reflected DoS |
| 42256 | 7.5 | NFS Shares World Readable |
| 90509 | 7.5 | Samba Badlock Vulnerability |

**Impact:**  
High-severity issues expose the system to denial-of-service attacks, unauthorized file access, and remote exploitation.

---

## Medium Severity Vulnerabilities

| Plugin ID | CVSS | Vulnerability Name |
|----------|------|-------------------|
| 139915 | 6.5 | ISC BIND Multiple Version DoS |
| 136808 | 5.9 | ISC BIND Denial of Service |

**Impact:**  
These vulnerabilities may allow service disruption or reduced availability.

---

## Low Severity Vulnerabilities

| Plugin ID | CVSS | Vulnerability Name |
|----------|------|-------------------|
| 10114 | 2.1 | ICMP Timestamp Request Remote Date Disclosure |

**Impact:**  
Low-risk information leakage that may assist attackers during reconnaissance.

---

## Informational Findings (Selected)

| Plugin ID | Finding |
|----------|---------|
| 10223 | RPC portmapper Service Detection |
| 10092 | FTP Server Detection |
| 10107 | HTTP Server Type and Version |
| 53335 | RPC portmapper (TCP) |
| 25240 | Samba Server Detection |
| 96982 | SMB Protocol Version 1 Enabled |
| 52703 | vsftpd Detection |
| 20094 | VMware Virtual Machine Detection |
| 10342 | VNC Software Detection |
| 10287 | Traceroute Information |

**Note:**  
Informational findings do not pose direct risk but help in **system enumeration** and attack surface mapping.

---

## Key Security Observations

- Presence of **bind shell backdoor** indicates critical compromise risk
- Multiple **legacy and insecure services** detected
- SMB, FTP, NFS, and VNC services significantly increase attack surface
- System intentionally configured to be vulnerable for testing purposes

---

## Risk Assessment

The target system demonstrates:
- High exposure to remote attacks
- Weak service configurations
- Insecure network services

This makes it suitable for **learning vulnerability scanning and analysis**, but unsafe for production environments.

---

## Conclusion

The Nessus vulnerability scan successfully identified critical, high, medium, and low-severity vulnerabilities on the target system.  
The results validate the importance of vulnerability assessment in identifying security weaknesses during network security testing.

## Disclaimer

This assessment was conducted **only in a controlled lab environment** for educational purposes as part of the internship program.  
No real-world or unauthorized systems were scanned.
